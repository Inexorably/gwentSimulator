// GwentAI
// Description: GwentAI's main member is a GwentGame object gg. The game instance inside of AI however
//              will only be knowledgeable of one player's hand and deck, so P2's hand/deck will generally
//              be empty (until they play a card). The game object is still going to be the same as the regular
//              class, but a lot of AI functions will be wrappers for underlying gwentMechanics functions.
